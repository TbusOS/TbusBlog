Depending on the size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy User Guide).\nTry answering these questions for your user in this page:\nWhat is it? Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.\nWhy do I want it? Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include:\nWhat is it good for?: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?\nWhat is it not good for?: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren’t for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.\nWhat is it not yet good for?: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.\nWhere should I go next? Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:\nGetting Started: Get started with $project Examples: Check out some example code!

u32 newval; arch_spinlock_t lockval; prefetchw(\u0026lock-\u003eslock); __asm__ __volatile__( \"1: ldrex %0, [%3]\\n\" \" add %1, %0, %4\\n\" \" strex %2, %1, [%3]\\n\" \" teq %2, #0\\n\" \" bne 1b\" : \"=\u0026r\" (lockval), \"=\u0026r\" (newval), \"=\u0026r\" (tmp) : \"r\" (\u0026lock-\u003eslock), \"I\" (1 \u003c\u003c TICKET_SHIFT) : \"cc\"); while (lockval.tickets.next != lockval.tickets.owner) { wfe(); lockval.tickets.owner = READ_ONCE(lock-\u003etickets.owner); } smp_mb(); } 我印象之前的 kernel 是没有这个 wfe 这个函数的，当 cpu0 获取到锁后，如果 cpu1 再想获取锁，此时会被 lock 住，然后进入死等的状态，那么 wfe 这个指令的作用是会让 cpu 进入 low power standby，这样可以降低功耗，本来发生竞态时其他的 cpu 都要等待这个锁释放才能运行，有了这个指令，相当于是“因祸得福”了，还可以降低功耗，当然这是有条件的，后面追溯并研究了一下 wfe 这个指令的作用。\n3 spinlock 与 WFE、SEV、WFI 首先 spin_lock 函数，搞内核的大家都知道，那么我把 linux-stable 的代码黏贴出来如下：\nstatic __always_inline void spin_lock(spinlock_t *lock) { raw_spin_lock(\u0026lock-\u003erlock); } #define raw_spin_lock(lock)\t_raw_spin_lock(lock) #ifndef CONFIG_INLINE_SPIN_LOCK void __lockfunc _raw_spin_lock(raw_spinlock_t *lock) { __raw_spin_lock(lock); } EXPORT_SYMBOL(_raw_spin_lock); #endif static inline void __raw_spin_lock(raw_spinlock_t *lock) { preempt_disable();

while (lockval.tickets.next != lockval.tickets.owner) { wfe(); lockval.tickets.owner = READ_ONCE(lock-\u003etickets.owner); } smp_mb(); } 对于 arm32：\n#if __LINUX_ARM_ARCH__ \u003e= 7 || \\ (__LINUX_ARM_ARCH__ == 6 \u0026\u0026 defined(CONFIG_CPU_32v6K)) #define sev()\t__asm__ __volatile__ (\"sev\" : : : \"memory\") #define wfe()\t__asm__ __volatile__ (\"wfe\" : : : \"memory\") #define wfi()\t__asm__ __volatile__ (\"wfi\" : : : \"memory\") #else #define wfe()\tdo { } while (0) #endif 对于 arm64：\n#define sev()\tasm volatile(\"sev\" : : : \"memory\") #define wfe()\tasm volatile(\"wfe\" : : : \"memory\") #define wfi()\tasm volatile(\"wfi\" : : : \"memory\") static inline void arch_spin_unlock(arch_spinlock_t *lock) { smp_mb(); lock-\u003etickets.owner++; dsb_sev(); } #define SEV\t__ALT_SMP_ASM(WASM(sev), WASM(nop)) static inline void dsb_sev(void) { dsb(ishst); __asm__(SEV); } #ifdef CONFIG_SMP #define __ALT_SMP_ASM(smp, up)\t\\ \"9998: \" smp \"\\n\"\t\\ \" .pushsection \\\".alt.smp.init\\\", \\\"a\\\"\\n\"\t\\ \" .long 9998b\\n\"\t\\ \" \" up \"\\n\"\t\\ \" .popsection\\n\" #else #define __ALT_SMP_ASM(smp, up)\tup #endif 以上我们可以看出，在 lock 的时候使用 WFE，在 unlock 的时候使用 SEV，这个必须要成对使用，原因我下面会说。\n对于内核版本 Linux 3.0.56：\nstatic inline void arch_spin_lock(arch_spinlock_t *lock) { unsigned long tmp;

smp_mb(); } 对于 Linux 2.6.18：\ndefine _raw_spin_lock(lock) __raw_spin_lock(\u0026(lock)-\u003eraw_lock) static inline void __raw_spin_lock(raw_spinlock_t *lock) { unsigned long tmp; __asm__ __volatile__( \"1: ldrex %0, [%1]\\n\" \" teq %0, #0\\n\" \" strexeq %0, %2, [%1]\\n\" \" teqeq %0, #0\\n\" \" bne 1b\" : \"=\u0026r\" (tmp) : \"r\" (\u0026lock-\u003elock), \"r\" (1) : \"cc\"); smp_mb(); } 以上大家可以看出，最早期的 kernel 版本是没有 wfe 这条指令的，后面的版本才有。\n4 WFE、SEV 与 WFI 的作用与工作原理 那这条指令的作用是什么呢？我们可以上 arm 官网去查看这条指令的描述：ARM Software development tools\nSEV\nSEV causes an event to be signaled to all cores within a multiprocessor system. If SEV is implemented, WFE must also be implemented.\nSEV 指令可以产生事件信号，发送给全部的 cpu，让他们唤醒。如果 SEV 实现了，那么 WFE 也必须被实现。这里的事件信号其实会表现为 Event register，这是个一 bit 的 register，如果有事件，那么此 bit 为真。\nWFE If the Event Register is not set, WFE suspends execution until one of the following events occurs:\n• an IRQ interrupt, unless masked by the CPSR I-bit • an FIQ interrupt, unless masked by the CPSR F-bit • an Imprecise Data abort, unless masked by the CPSR A-bit • a Debug Entry request, if Debug is enabled • an Event signaled by another processor using the SEV instruction.\nIf the Event Register is set, WFE clears it and returns immediately. If WFE is implemented, SEV must also be implemented.\n对于 WFE，如果 Event Register 没有设置，WFE 会让 cpu 进入 low-power state，直到下面列举的五个 events 产生，比如说中断等等都会唤醒当前因为 WFE 而 suspend 的cpu。\n如果 Event Register 被设置了，那么 WFE 会直接返回，不让 cpu 进入low-power state，目的是因为既然有事件产生了，说明当前 cpu 需要干活，不能 suspend，所以才这样设计。\n这里我很好奇 Event Register 到底是怎么理解的。因此需要阅读手册《ARM Architecture Reference Manual.pdf》，下面我会做说明。\nWFI WFI suspends execution until one of the following events occurs:\n• an IRQ interrupt, regardless of the CPSR I-bit • an FIQ interrupt, regardless of the CPSR F-bit • an Imprecise Data abort, unless masked by the CPSR A-bit • a Debug Entry request, regardless of whether Debug is enabled.\n而对于 WFI 这种，不会判断 Event register，暴力的直接让 cpu 进入 low-power state，直到有上述四个 events 产生才会唤醒 cpu。\n注意，这里 WFE 比 WFI 多了一个唤醒特性：\nan Event signaled by another processor using the SEV instruction.\n也就是说 SEV 是不会唤醒 WFI 指令休眠的 cpu 的。这点需要特别注意。\n接下来我谈下这个 Event Register 是怎么回事了。看这个文档《ARM Architecture Reference Manual.pdf》\nThe Event Register The Event Register is a single bit register for each processor. When set, an event register indicates that an event has occurred, since the register was last cleared, that might require some action by the processor. Therefore, the processor must not suspend operation on issuing a WFE instruction.\nThe reset value of the Event Register is UNKNOWN.\nThe Event Register is set by:\n• an SEV instruction • an event sent by some IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED mechanism • a debug event that causes entry into Debug state • an exception return.\nAs shown in this list, the Event Register might be set by IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED mechanisms. The Event Register is cleared only by a Wait For Event instruction. Software cannot read or write the value of the Event Register directly.\n以上就是 Event Register 的表述，上述已经说的很明白了，Event Register 只有一个 bit，可以被 set 的情况总有四种大类型。当任意一个条件满足的时候，Event Register 都可以被 set，那么当 WFE 进入的时候会进行 Event Register 的判断，如果为真，就直接返回。\n再来看看 WFE 的介绍：\nWait For Event is a hint instruction that permits the processor to enter a low-power state until one of a number of events occurs, including events signaled by executing the SEV instruction on any processor in the multiprocessor system. For more information, see Wait For Event and Send Event on page B1-1197.\nIn an implementation that includes the Virtualization Extensions, if HCR.TWE is set to 1, execution of a WFE instruction in a Non-secure mode other than Hyp mode generates a Hyp Trap exception if, ignoring the value of the HCR.TWE bit, conditions permit the processor to suspend execution. For more information see Trapping use of the WFI and WFE instructions on page B1-1249.\n接下来上 WFE 这条指令的伪代码流程：\nAssembler syntax WFE{\u003cc\u003e}{\u003cq\u003e} where: \u003cc\u003e, \u003cq\u003e See Standard assembler syntax fields on page A8-285. Operation if ConditionPassed() then EncodingSpecificOperations(); if EventRegistered() then ClearEventRegister(); else if HaveVirtExt() \u0026\u0026 !IsSecure() \u0026\u0026 !CurrentModeIsHyp() \u0026\u0026 HCR.TWE == '1' then HSRString = Zeros(25); HSRString\u003c0\u003e = '1'; WriteHSR('000001', HSRString); TakeHypTrapException(); else WaitForEvent(); Exceptions Hyp Trap. 看了上面这段 WFE 的伪代码，一目了然，首先判断 ConditionPassed()，这些函数大家可以在 arm 手册中查看其详细含义，如果 EventResigerted() 函数为真，也就是这个 1 bit 的寄存器为真，那么就清除此 bit，然后退出返回，不会让 cpu 进入 low power state；\n如果不是异常处理，TakeHypTrapException()，那么就 WaitForEvent()，等待唤醒事件到来，到来了，就唤醒当前 cpu。\n为什么有事件来了就直接返回呢，因为 WFE 的设计认为，如果此时有 event 事件，那么说明当前 cpu 要干活，那就没必要进入 low power state 模式。\n如果没有事件产生，那么就可以进入 low power state 模式，因为 cpu 反正也是在等待锁，此时也干不了别的事情，还不如休眠还可以降低功耗。\n当然，irq，fiq 等很多中断都可以让 WFE 休眠的 cpu 唤醒，那么这样做还有什么意义呢？比如说时钟中断是一直产生的，那么 cpu 很快就醒了啊，都不用等到发 SEV，那么既然是用 spin_lock，也可以在中断上半部使用，也可以在进程上下文，既然是自旋锁，就意味着保护的这段代码是要足够精简，不希望被其他东西打断，那么如果你保护的这部分代码非常长，这时候整个系统响应很可能会变慢，因为如果这时候有人也要使用这个锁的话，那么是否保护的这段代码设计上是有问题的。因此用 spin_lock 保护的函数尽可能要短，如果长的话可能需要换其他锁，或者考虑下是否真的要这么长的保护措施。\nTakeHypTrapException()，是进入异常处理\nPseudocode description of taking the Hyp Trap exception The TakeHypTrapException() pseudocode procedure describes how the processor takes the exception: // TakeHypTrapException() // ====================== TakeHypTrapException() // HypTrapException is caused by executing an instruction that is trapped to Hyp mode as a // result of a trap set by a bit in the HCR, HCPTR, HSTR or HDCR. By definition, it can only // be generated in a Non-secure mode other than Hyp mode. // Note that, when a Supervisor Call exception is taken to Hyp mode because HCR.TGE==1, this // is not a trap of the SVC instruction. See the TakeSVCException() pseudocode for this case. preferred_exceptn_return = if CPSR.T == '1' then PC-4 else PC-8; new_spsr_value = CPSR; EnterHypMode(new_spsr_value, preferred_exceptn_return, 20); Additional pseudocode functions for exception handling on page B1-1221 defines the EnterHypMode() pseudocode procedure. arm spec\nClearEventRegister()\nClear the Event Register of the current processor 清除Event Register的bit\nEventRegistered()\nDetermine whether the Event Register of the current processor is set Event Register bit为真，即被设置过\nWaitForEvent()\nWait until WFE instruction completes\n等待 Events 事件，有任何一个 Event 事件来临，都会唤醒当前被 WFE suspend 下去的 cpu， 如果是 SEV，会唤醒全部被 WFE suspend 下去的cpu。\n如下是关于 WFE 的 wake up events 事件描述和列举：\nWFE wake-up events\nThe following events are WFE wake-up events:\n• the execution of an SEV instruction on any processor in the multiprocessor system • a physical IRQ interrupt, unless masked by the CPSR.I bit • a physical FIQ interrupt, unless masked by the CPSR.F bit • a physical asynchronous abort, unless masked by the CPSR.A bit • in Non-secure state in any mode other than Hyp mode: — when HCR.IMO is set to 1, a virtual IRQ interrupt, unless masked by the CPSR.I bit — when HCR.FMO is set to 1, a virtual FIQ interrupt, unless masked by the CPSR.F bit — when HCR.AMO is set to 1, a virtual asynchronous abort, unless masked by the CPSR.A bit • an asynchronous debug event, if invasive debug is enabled and the debug event is permitted • an event sent by the timer event stream, see Event streams on page B8-1934 • an event sent by some IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED mechanism.\nIn addition to the possible masking of WFE wake-up events shown in this list, when invasive debug is enabled and DBGDSCR[15:14] is not set to 0b00, DBGDSCR.INTdis can mask interrupts, including masking them acting as WFE wake-up events. For more information, see DBGDSCR, Debug Status and Control Register on page C11-2206. As shown in the list of wake-up events, an implementation can include IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED hardware mechanisms to generate wake-up events. NoteFor more information about CPSR masking see Asynchronous exception masking on page B1-1181. If the configuration of the masking controls provided by the Security Extensions, or Virtualization Extensions, mean that a CPSR mask bit cannot mask the corresponding exception, then the physical exception is a WFE wake-up event, regardless of the value of the CPSR mask bit.\n接下来我们看下 WFI 的伪代码：\nAssembler syntax WFI{\u003cc\u003e}{\u003cq\u003e} where: \u003cc\u003e, \u003cq\u003e See Standard assembler syntax fields on page A8-285. Operation if ConditionPassed() then EncodingSpecificOperations(); if HaveVirtExt() \u0026\u0026 !IsSecure() \u0026\u0026 !CurrentModeIsHyp() \u0026\u0026 HCR.TWI == '1' then HSRString = Zeros(25); HSRString\u003c0\u003e = '1'; WriteHSR('000001', HSRString); TakeHypTrapException(); else WaitForInterrupt(); Exceptions Hyp Trap. 相关解释：\nWFI\nWait For Interrupt is a hint instruction that permits the processor to enter a low-power state until one of a number of asynchronous events occurs. For more information, see Wait For Interrupt on page B1-1200. In an implementation that includes the Virtualization Extensions, if HCR.TWI is set to 1, execution of a WFE instruction in a Non-secure mode other than Hyp mode generates a Hyp Trap exception if, ignoring the value of the HCR.TWI bit, conditions permit the processor to suspend execution. For more information see Trapping use of the WFI and WFE instructions on page B1-1249.\n以上我们可以看出，WFI 并没有去判断 event register，因此看伪代码可以很直观的看出 WFI 与 WFE 的区别。\n以上是我个人的理解，如果有表述不精准或者不准确的地方还请大家指出，欢迎交流。\n5 参考资料 ARM 架构下 spinlock 原理 (代码解读) ARM WFI 和 WFE 指令 ARM Software development tools Linux 内核自旋锁 spinlock_t 机制 ","categories":["cpu"],"description":"今天我想分享一个跟多核锁原理相关的东西，由于我搞 arm 居多，所以目前只研究了 arm 架构下的 WFE 指令，分享出来，如果有表述不精准或者错误的地方还请大家指出，非常感谢。研究这个原因也是只是想搞清楚所以然和来龙去脉，以后写代码可以更游刃有余.","excerpt":"今天我想分享一个跟多核锁原理相关的东西，由于我搞 arm 居多，所以目前只研究了 arm 架构下的 WFE 指令，分享出来，如果有表述不精准 …","ref":"/blog/2022/07/19/cpu%E5%A4%9A%E6%A0%B8%E9%94%81%E6%8C%87%E4%BB%A4-wfe%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86/","tags":["arm","wfe","spin_lock"],"title":"cpu多核锁指令-WFE原理"},{"body":"版本信息 系统版本：Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS 64bit 编译器：9.4.0 交叉编译器：arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc (Linaro GCC 7.5-2019.12) 7.5.0 linux内核：linux-5.15.53 busybox：1.35.0 QEMU：7.0.0 ninja-build：1.10.0\n获取交叉编译链 下载地址：Linaro Releases tar xvf gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabi.tar.tar\t#解压 vi ~/.bashrc\t#修改环境变量PATH，让系统先去指定目录寻找交叉编译链的可执行文件 在.bashrc文件加上这行，交叉工具链的目录取决于自己解压的目录 export PATH=/home/ubuntu/gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabi/bin:$PATH\nsource ~/.bashrc\t#让.bashrc生效 安装成功 编译QEMU sudo apt-get install ninja-build\t#Need ninja.

Use these to choose your core tasks. Each granular use case (enable x, configure y) should have a corresponding tasks page or tasks page section. Users should be able to quickly refer to your core tasks when they need to find out how to do one specific thing, rather than having to look for the instructions in a bigger tutorial or example. Think of your tasks pages as a cookbook with different procedures your users can combine to create something more substantial.\nYou can give each task a page, or you can group related tasks together in a page, such as tasks related to a particular feature. As well as grouping related tasks in single pages, you can also group task pages in nested folders with an index page as an overview, as seen in this example site. Or if you have a small docset like the Docsy User Guide with no Tutorials or Concepts pages, consider adding your feature-specific pages at the top level of your docs rather than in a Tasks section.\nEach task should give the user\nThe prerequisites for this task, if any (this can be specified at the top of a multi-task page if they’re the same for all the page’s tasks. “All these tasks assume that you understand….and that you have already….”). What this task accomplishes. Instructions for the task. If it involves editing a file, running a command, or writing code, provide code-formatted example snippets to show the user what to do! If there are multiple steps, provide them as a numbered list. If appropriate, links to related concept, tutorial, or example pages.

If you have already created some Examples for your project you can base Tutorials on them. This section is optional. However, remember that although you may not need this section at first, having tutorials can be useful to help your users engage with your example code, especially if there are aspects that need more explanation than you can easily provide in code comments.\n","categories":"","description":"Show your user how to work through some end to end examples.\n","excerpt":"Show your user how to work through some end to end examples.\n","ref":"/en/docs/tutorials/","tags":"","title":"Tutorials"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\nIf your project has an API, configuration, or other reference - anything that users need to look up that’s at an even lower level than a single task - put (or link to it) here. You can serve and link to generated reference docs created using Doxygen, Javadoc, or other doc generation tools by putting them in your static/ directory. Find out more in Adding static content. For OpenAPI reference, Docsy also provides a Swagger UI layout and shortcode that renders Swagger UI using any OpenAPI YAML or JSON file as source.\n","categories":"","description":"Low level reference docs for your project.\n","excerpt":"Low level reference docs for your project.\n","ref":"/en/docs/reference/","tags":"","title":"Reference"},{"body":" These basic sample guidelines assume that your Docsy site is deployed using Netlify and your files are stored in GitHub. You can use the guidelines “as is” or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project’s file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon’t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\nWe use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\nFork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers. Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\nClick Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes. Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\nFollow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\nFork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\nContinue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\nCreating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.
